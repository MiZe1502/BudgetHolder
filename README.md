# What
SPA for home budget management. 

# Stack
Frontend: Svelte + Scss + Typescript + Svelte testing library
Backend: Go
DB: MySQL

# Explanation
Used plain Svelte framework without Sapper to better understand its features and practice my skills.
I`ve never used Go for real-life projects and REST API, so it was new experience for me.
