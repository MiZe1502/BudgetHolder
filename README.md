# What
SPA for home budget management. <br />

# Stack
Frontend: Svelte + Emotion CSS-in-JS + Typescript + Svelte testing library <br />
Backend: Go <br />
DB: MySQL <br />

# Explanation
Used plain Svelte framework without Sapper to better understand its features and practice my skills. <br />
I`ve never used Go for real-life projects and REST API, so it was new experience for me. <br />
